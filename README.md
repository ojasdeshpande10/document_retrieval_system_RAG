# NVIDIA NIM-Enhanced RAG Application

## Overview
This project integrates NVIDIA NIM endpoints to harness powerful NLP capabilities, enabling a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Users can upload documents to create embeddings, which are then accessible through a conversational interface, allowing for dynamic interactions with the uploaded content.

## Key Features
- **Document Upload**: Easily upload documents to generate searchable embeddings.
- **Interactive Chat**: Query uploaded documents in a conversational manner using a chat interface.
- **NVIDIA NIM Integration**: Leverage advanced NLP processing capabilities provided by NVIDIA NIM endpoints.
